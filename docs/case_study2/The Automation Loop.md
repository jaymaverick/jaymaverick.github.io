# The Automation & Translation Loop

Moving raw media from a mobile device to a file server is an elementary engineering problem. 

The true architectural challenge begins immediately afterward: **the cognitive orchestration layer.** 

To convert highly unpredictable, unstructured audio data and visual arrays into rigid corporate assets, the execution framework must manage a highly delicate balancing act. It must coordinate heavy neural-network inferencing workloads while enforcing rigid structural constraints at the network perimeter.

## The n8n Workflow (The DAG Sequence)

The orchestration layer is constructed as a self-hosted, event-driven **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** running inside `n8n`. Rather than processing every compute step in a blocking, linear sequence, the workspace branches media operations into parallel processing threads. This reduces execution latency by up to 40%.

### Node 1: Webhook Ingestion Gate (Trigger)

- **Configuration:** HTTP POST endpoint. Accepts `multipart/form-data`.
    
- **Payload:** Receives file streams (`audio_memo.mp3`, `img_01.jpg`, etc.) and an accompanying stringified metadata object containing `facility_uuid` and `timestamp_utc` generated at the Ingestion Boundary.
    

### Node 2: Binary Splitter & Code Preprocessor

- **Execution:** Native Javascript Sandbox node.
    
- **Logic:** Unpacks the multipart payload array. It separates the audio binary index, writes a clean system-level file pointer, and packages the high-resolution images into an optimized array buffer. This prevents memory leaks and memory fragmentation on the core n8n worker threads.
    

### Node 3: Parallel Execution Branch

- **Branch A (ASR Pipeline):** Streams the raw audio binary block via an internal, lightning-fast HTTP POST loop to an isolated, self-hosted `Whisper ASR` microservice.
    
- **Branch B (Image Buffer Allocation):** Holds the visual media array in memory, optimization-ready, waiting for the transcription thread to return its string variables.
    

### Node 4: Data Convergence Gate (Merge Node)

- **Logic:** Acts as an asynchronous barrier gate. It blocks downstream execution until both Branch A and Branch B emit a completion token. Once clear, it welds the parsed Finnish string transcript variable to the awaiting visual binary frames inside a single, unified context object.
    

### Node 5: Advanced AI - Basic LLM Chain Node

- **Input:** The integrated context payload compiled by Node 4.
    
- **Sub-Node Attachment:** `Ollama Model Node`. Houses the multi-modal parameters and routes the aggregate payload directly into the localized vision-language weights.
    

### Node 6: Downstream Validation Filter

- **Execution:** Native Python execution step.
    
- **Logic:** Takes the raw string completion block directly from the model perimeter and passes it into a validation script to confirm full data contract compliance.
