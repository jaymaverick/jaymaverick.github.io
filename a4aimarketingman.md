<h2 id="content">Communicator By Heart, Developer By Head</h2>
<p>The one thing that lights my fire is communication and figuring people out. I love to find ways of understanding and connecting with different kinds of people. And because I'm an engineer and nerd by heart, I find myself spending time with marketers, developers and other nerds.</p>
<p>I got into content marketing because I love to learn concepts and then teach them in clever ways to others like me. More often that meant creating content about my company's products and helping our customers learn how to use them.</p>
<p>When LLM based AI came along, my content marketing career took a sharp turn into creating mindless AI content for SEO companies. Creating faceless and soulless content at scale moved me further and further away from what I love: connecting with people.</p>
<p>Which is ultimately why I now brand myself as a community manager. AI is good for a lot of things - generating text on the internet is not one of them. Luckily, you can't foster a healthy and engaged community without being a human.</p>
<p>And I can do human.</p>
<p>Still, here are some of the cool stuff I did as an AI marketing manager:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Experimented with LLM tools</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Most LLM tools are still overpriced garbage, sadly. But the ones that work are incredible. I used ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 for most of my work, spending probably hundreds of hours figuring out the best prompts and ways to make it do my bidding.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>AI content creation</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Working for Smash Digital, the goal was to get AI to generate basic SEO articles around some particular keywords. After 3-4 months of experimentation, I got a pipeline working. We were able to push 5-10 articles per week on really difficult niche keywords, like "micro private equity" and "SBA loans". Problem is, 50% of the job was still done by our human team.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Scripting with LLMs</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The real power of LLM comes from connecting it to a quality source and using LLM to turn that content into something else.</p>
		<p>We're talking speech to text, summarizing notes, serving pieces from documentation etc. Kind of like what AssemblyAI does. Using Google Docs and a few choice Python scripts, I was able to take a Youtube video and use it as a source for ChatGPT. Or take a document and turn it into keywords, that sort of stuff. But since I'm not a Python wizard, nor did Smash Digital need this sort of project, this project was left by the wayside.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>LangChain development</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I found LangChain through AssemblyAI's videos on the topic. It opened up a whole new world of LLM potential for me, and I do believe there's massive potential there. Speaking with Bobby Peddi from truic.com, who has actually made good progress using LangChain, it seems I was right. I've recently started learning more about the scripting and programming skills required to be able to utilize these systems. </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Content reation / SEO tools</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>After almost 10 years creating content for the internet, I'm quite familiar with Ahrefs. I know how to do keyword research and create articles. That part isn't difficult, or much fun to be honest. What I've always been passionate about is helping people learn. Creating community through targeted content. The pieces of content that I created to create a dialog with a specific type of reader have been my most successful ones.</p>
