			<h1>Event Organization and Hosting</h1>
		</header>

<p>I'm not a major event organizer, but I've had the privilege of helping with a handful of big events. Here are some of the more recent ones:</p>

<h2 id="content">2023 - SEO Estonia / Tallinn</h2>
<p>Back in 2022, the SEO wizard Karl Kangur wanted me to assist with SEO Estonia, the SEO conference in Tallinn. I had helped Karl with a few of his projects before, and he knew I was ready to put my community building skills to work. Plus I live close to Tallinn. So we pulled together all the big SEO players to the tiny European Metropolis of Tallinn and had an absolute blast. This cooperation lead to my position at Smash Digital, working as an AI Content Marketing Manager.</p>

<h2 id="content">2019 - Limitless Man / Sofia</h2>
<p>When I was deep into the relationship coaching industry, I was working with Ryan Black, the illustrious man behind Sasha Daygame. We wanted to pull together a conference for men who wanted to take control of their own lives. Not just on the relationship front, but in every aspect of their lives. So for 3 days, we invaded Sofia with workshops, talks and panel discussions.</p>

<h2 id="content">Smaller Events</h2>
<p>My favorite things are the smaller events that we organize through various communities. It's an easy way to get people to attend, and a low investment for anyone wanting to give a short talk or host a workshop. Here are a few memorable events I organized.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>2019 - Start a Business Today / Zagreb</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I was working in Zagreb at a local co-working space. We were brainstorming business ideas in the lounge, while people came and went one-upping each others' suggestions. We turned it into an event. We gathered 20 locals who wanted to share their business ideas, but needed help getting started.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2018 - Link Building For Affiliate Blogs / Barcelona</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>As an extension of the Wordpress community in Barcelona, we held this event to teach the basics of making your blog stand out with simple link building techniques.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2018 - Build a Blog in 30 Minutes using Wordpress / Barcelona</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Another extension of the Wordpress community in Barcelona, this was a simple workshop to get people started on using Wordpress.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2017 - Super Bomberman Tournament / Budapest</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>As part of NES Players Budapest, we held a Super Bomberman tournament with the few SNES consoles we had available. It was simple, it was silly and it was a whole lot of fun.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>2017 - Pop-up Restaurant / Portugal</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Our 3 month company getaway in Portugal involved a private chef (the CEO's cousin). This amazing Greek food wizard was ready to show his talent, so we arranged to have a local niche restaurant host a pop-up evening with his dishes on display. A good number of people attended the event, 8 tables were full and rotating for whole evening. </p>

<h2 id="content">Speaking Events</h2>
<p>I'm not a naturally outgoing guy, but I love to be able to express myself and communicate my ideas. That's why I practice speaking as often as I can. Here are some of my favorite talks:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>2024 - Keys To IT Project Success / Helsinki</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I wanted to learn programming, so I applied to the Hive School in Helsinki, a 42 School-offshoot. Here's me talking about how to effectively communicate within a software engineering project team.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2022 - Client Acquisition For Freelancers / Helsinki</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I made a small workshop for client acquisition in the Oodi Library. I don't have much experience speaking for Finnish audiences, so I wanted to try this out. </p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2021 - Client Acquisition For Freelancers / Budapest</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Here's me at the Impact Hub in Budapest talking about finding clients.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2021 - Speaking Without Stage Fright / Pärnu</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>How do you speak without running out of things to say? I spoke at Pärnu University about overcoming stage fright and what to do when you run out of words.</p>
	</dd>
    <dt>2020 - Psychology and Relationship Dynamics / Helsinki</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This was a talk about basic ideas of using acceptance as a foundation for healthy relationships.</p>
	</dd>
